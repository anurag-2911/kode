## System Design
  - Approach
    - Understand the problem and clarify all the requirements
    - Write high-level design and high-level diagrams
    - Implement all the components of high-level diagrams in detail

  - API Gateway
  - Load Balancer
  - Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling
  - Web Server
      - Stateful and Stateless architecture
  - Application Server
  - Database : SQL | NoSQL  GraphDB | DocumentDB | Replication | Partitioning(Sharding) 
  - Cache: Redis | MemCache
  - CDN
  - Message Queues |  Event-driven architecture
