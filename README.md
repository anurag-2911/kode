## System Design
  - Approach
    - Understand the problem and clarify all the requirements
    - Write high-level design and high-level diagrams
    - Implement all the components of high-level diagrams in detail
    - Tool: https://excalidraw.com/
        
  - API Gateway
  - Load Balancer
  - Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling
  - Web Server
      - Stateful and Stateless architecture
  - Application Server
  - Database : SQL | NoSQL | GraphDB | DocumentDB | Replication | Partitioning(Sharding) 
  - Cache: Redis | MemCache
  - CDN
  - Message Queues |  Event-driven architecture
  - Microservices and communication patterns: REST | gRPC | GraphQL | Message Queues
  - Logging, metrics, automation
  - Back of the envelope Calculation: QPS | Storage | Number of Servers
  - High-Level Design Problems (HLDs)
     - URL Shortener
     - Rate Limiter
        - Token Bucket Algorithm
     - Storage based Design
        - S3-like storage system
        - CDN
        - Google Drive
     - Content streaming-based design
         - You Tube
         - Netflix
     -  E-commerce
         - Design Hotel reservation
         - Design Shopping websites like Amazon
     -  Graph-Based design:
        - Web crawler
        - Google Map
        - Search Engine
        - Nearby Friends
        - News Feed

## Low-Level Design (LLDs)
  - Rate Limiter
        - Token Bucket Algorithm (Example code: kode\lld\lld_test.go)
  - Meeting Scheduler
  - HashTable
  - LRU Cache

## DSA Problems
   - Arrays | Strings | HashTable | Queues | LinkList | Stack | Search | Sort | Graph | Recursion | Dynamic Programming
   - Arrays common problems
     - Reverse an Array
     - Find the Missing Number in natural numbers (Asked in Amazon)
     - Rotate Array
     - Find the Duplicate Number
     - Merge Two Sorted Arrays(Asked in HelloFresh)
   - String Common problems
   - 

## Go Concepts
  - Loops
  - Channels and Go Routines
  - Structs and interfaces
  - Channel patterns
  - Packages like go-gin for REST, gorm for database interactions
  - error handling in go
  - pointers
  - slices, arrays, and maps
  - Which OOPs concepts are supported in Go
  - 
## Behavioural
  - Use Star Technique: Situation, Task, Action and Result: https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-use-the-star-interview-response-technique
  - Why do you want to join our company?
  - Explain the most challenging task you have done in your career.
  - Could you tell me a situation when you got constructive feedback?
  - Could you tell me when you had a difficult interaction with a team-mate?
  - Explain about your team and interaction with stakeholders in day-to-day tasks.
  - Could you explain your role in the team?
  - If you are interacting with other team's team members and the task is not done by that team member how you will approach the situation?
  - How do team members describe you, what they like in you, and what they don't like in you?
## CI/CD
  - Explain Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Delivery done in your project.
  - Can you describe the CI/CD pipeline and its key stages
  - What tools are you familiar with for implementing CI/CD?
  - How do you handle database schema changes in CI/CD pipelines?
  - What are some common problems in CI/CD, and how can they be mitigated
  - What is containerization, and how does it integrate with CI/CD pipelines?
  - How do you ensure security within your CI/CD pipeline?
  - What is blue-green deployment, and why is it used in CD?
  - Can you explain how monitoring and logging are handled in CI/CD environments?
  - 



## UTs and CTs

## Microservices
  - What are microservices? What are the challenges in microservices architecture?
  - Can you explain the concept of domain-driven design (DDD) in the context of microservices?
  - How do microservices communicate with each other?
    (synchronous and asynchronous communication methods between microservices, such as RESTful APIs, messaging queues, and event streams)
  - What are some common patterns used in microservices architecture?
    (API Gateway, Circuit Breaker, Service Discovery, and Config Server)
  - What challenges might you face while implementing microservices and how would you address them?
  - How do you handle data management in a microservices architecture?
  - What role do containers and container orchestration tools play in microservices?
  - How do you ensure the security of microservices?
