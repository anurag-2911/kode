## System Design
  - Approach
    - Understand the problem and clarify all the requirements
    - Write high-level design and high-level diagrams
    - Implement all the components of high-level diagrams in detail
    - Tool: https://excalidraw.com/
        
  - API Gateway
  - Load Balancer
  - Vertical Scaling and Horizontal Scaling
  - Web Server
      - Stateful and Stateless architecture
  - Application Server
  - Database : SQL | NoSQL | GraphDB | DocumentDB | Replication | Partitioning(Sharding) 
  - Cache: Redis | MemCache
  - CDN
  - Message Queues |  Event-driven architecture
  - Microservices and communication patterns: REST | gRPC | GraphQL | Message Queues
  - Logging, metrics, automation
  - Back of the envelope Calculation: QPS | Storage | Number of Servers
  - High-Level Design Problems (HLDs)
     - URL Shortener
     - Rate Limiter
        - Token Bucket Algorithm 

## Low-Level Design (LLDs)
  - Rate Limiter
        - Token Bucket Algorithm (Example code: kode\lld\lld_test.go)
  - Meeting Scheduler
  - HashTable
  - LRU Cache

## DSA Problems
   - Arrays | Strings | HashTable | Queues | LinkList | Stack | Search | Sort | Graph | Recursion | Dynamic Programming
   - Arrays common problems
     - Reverse an Array
     - Find the Missing Number in natural numbers (Asked in Amazon)
     - Rotate Array
     - Find the Duplicate Number
     - Merge Two Sorted Arrays(Asked in HelloFresh)
   - String Common problems
   - 

## Go Concepts
  - Loops
  - Channels and Go Routines
  - Structs and interfaces
  - Channel patterns
  - Packages like go-gin for REST, gorm for database interactions
  - error handling in go
  - pointers
  - slices, arrays, and maps
  - 
## Behavioural
  - Why do you want to join our company?
  - Explain the most challenging task you have done in your career.
  - Could you tell me a situation when you got constructive feedback?
  - Could you tell me when you had a difficult interaction with a team-mate?
  - Explain about your team and interaction with stakeholders in day-to-day tasks.
  - Explain about your role in the team.
