1. **Find the Maximum and Minimum Element in an Array** - 
	Write a function that returns the maximum and minimum numbers in an array.

2. **Reverse an Array** - Implement a program to reverse an array or a string.

3. **Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s** - Given an array consisting only of 0s, 1s, and 2s, 
	sort the array without using any sorting algorithm.

4. **Find the "Kth" Max and Min Element of an Array** - 
	Given an array and a number k, find both the kth largest and the kth smallest elements in the array.

5. **Move all the Negative Elements to One Side of the Array** - 
	Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear on the left, and positive numbers appear on the right.

6. **Find the Duplicate in an Array of N+1 Integers** - 
	Assume there is exactly one duplicate number in the array, find the duplicate one.

7. **Merge Two Sorted Arrays Without Using Extra Space** - 
	Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array without using extra space for another array.

8. **Kadane's Algorithm** - Write a function that returns the maximum sum contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional numeric array.

9. **Find the Union and Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays** - Given two sorted arrays, 
	find their union and intersection.
